        Data-driven IDSs, on the other hand, utilize machine learning 
        techniques to overcome these limitations. Examples include
        works by Lee et al. and Abbaspour et al., which
        use support vector regression and adaptive neural networks,
        respectively. These approaches can adapt to new types of
        attacks and changing system conditions by learning from data.
        However, these studies often focus on single UAVs and do
        not consider cyber-physical data fusion or real communication
        with UAVs to obtain datasets.
